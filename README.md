Here is the practice about how to make models that are trained by python code in <a href="https://github.com/acerwebai/VangoghCrazyWorld"> VangoghCrazyWorld</a>.<br/>
It's implemented by ML5.js and P5.js. <br/>
ML5.js is a high end API base on TensorFlow.js that published by Google.
You can get mode details from the <a href="https://ml5js.org/">ML5.js web</a> and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js/">tensorflow.js web </a>
